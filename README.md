# Marble Marcher

*Original game and text by CodeParade aka HackerPoet*

Marble Marcher is a video game demo that uses a fractal physics engine and fully procedural rendering to produce beautiful and unique gameplay unlike anything you've seen before.

The goal of the game is to reach the flag as quickly as possible. But be careful not to
fall off the level or get crushed by the fractal! There are 24 levels to unlock.

## Web Port
This is an experimental, work-in-progress port of Marble Marcher to WebGL.
The same slow fractal rendering technique has to be used, so expect lower performance than the PC version especially on lower-end devices.
The output resolution will be selectable, though an "automatic" option may be added in the future, along with post-processing to improve upscaling of low resolutions.

## Feature Development
I currently have no plans to implement new features, including those added in Marble Marcher Community Edition (hence a fork of the original repository).
